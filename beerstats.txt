        Kentucky Monk is a bourbon barrel aged Belgian triple that is crafted with Belgian Pilsen malt, white wheat, Crystal 10, and exclusively Saaz hops. The Cantrell Honey Farm in Athens, Ohio supplies gallons of locally harvested Golden Rod honey for this brew. The honey is added at the end of the boil to give this Belgian style triple an elevation in flavor and alcohol. The interplay of fruit/clove character from our Belgian yeast and the local honey is apparent but not aggressive. After this Belgian style triple is ready for consumption, we age a portion of this heavenly brew in bourbon barrels to create Kentucky Monk. Wonderful vanilla and coconut aromas and flavors penetrate the beer. Hints of bourbon, caramel, and honey take Kentucky Monk to a whole new level. An amazing aperitif that embraces Belgian brewing tradition and American craft brewing creativity.

Northwest two-row malt is mashed without the addition of specialty malts for a light, golden color. The wort is lightly hopped in the kettle for minimum bitterness and imported Saaz hops give the beer a subtle, noble hop flavor and aroma.

        Driven by a life of humble contemplation, Trappist Monks have quietly been rolling out barrels of rich, full flavoured ales for centuries. While the old world tradition of Trappist Ales continues to influence brewers around the world, a new world order has been bubbling away with bold aromatic US hops playing the headline act. Melding the old and the new worlds, we have introduced rich, sweet malt tones derived from select Belgian specialty malts and fruity Belgian yeast spiked with the addition of classic candied sugar together with the unmistakeable aromatics of new season US Cascade and Chinook hops. A thought provoking bitterness completes a hybrid ale that is contradictive in style - The Quiet American

Its bouquet is the result of a large array of floral and fruity esters which are complemented by a light and delicate fragrance of malts and hops. The first draught reveals a full-bodied beer with a malty sweetness and a warm touch of alcohol. A hint of acidity is discovered in the aftertaste, but it is quickly overcome by the sharp bitterness of the hops. The Rigor Mortis are complex beers designed and brewed with patience and care in the tradition of the great Belgian Abbey beers.

An authentic abbey ale, the age-old tradition of the White Canons of Tongerlo lives on in this officially recognised Belgian abbey ale. Re-fermentation in the bottle gives this beer a more intense taste and aroma as well as a longer shelf life. Tongerlo Prior was chosen as the best European blond abbey/trappist ale in the 2011 World Beer Awards.

        Why is the Grim Reaper holding a mailbox? Well, that mailbox is from a dead Dark Horse beer. The Grim Reaper better know as "Death" was quite fond of our classic Sapient Summer Wheat Ale.  When we changed it into a Belgian Style Triple, Death thought it would only be appropriate to bring something from that beer into this beer. So he picked the mailbox,  and we werent about to argue with him. You can say what you want about him, but that Death sure has a big heart.
So anyway...we brewed this beer with a Trappist yeast strain so it is very traditional. The flavors are incredibly complex with notes of mild fruit and finishes with a bit of clove. Although this beer is higher in alcohol it is very  smooth and finishes dry on the palate.

Ondineke is an unfiltered top fermenting beer. It is soft, creamy, and of golden color. It is double hopped with the last real hops available from the region of Aalst (The variety is Hallertau Mittelfrüh).
Ondineke has a positive taste evolution and the bottles are best kept standing in a cool, dark place. It is best before two years after the bottling date.
8.5 % alc.vol. makes this a beer to be savoured. Preferably Ondineke is to be served at a temperature between 6 to 10° C. Moreover Ondineke is at its best when served in the originally designed Glazen Toren glass.

        Great Tripels are a testament to the skill of the brewer-monks who created them. Tripels play tricks on the sensesat first glance, they appear delicate and simple, but in reality, the golden color and mild appearance conceal a wealth of complex flavors. Ovila Abbey Tripel is our take on the classic style, with toasty malt sweetness balanced by reserved floral hop notes and complemented by a traditional Belgian abbey yeast. We hope you enjoy this collaboration ale.

Founded in 1970 , this beer was offered earlier this year to the most loyal customers of our brewery ( hence the name "With the best wishes of the brewery Dupont ").
The success this beer earned lead to it being made commercially, while retaining its original name. Although very popular, it was brewed in limited quantities, the bottles reserved many months in advance.
A coppery blond beer with aromas of hops for the Bon Voeux is a beer tasting combining mellow bitterness and fruity.
Our selection of yeasts and a long maturation phase with hopping gives it flavor and a characteristic and complex taste.
The true fermentation in the bottle , which can be extended very long in your cellar, resulting in a balanced and harmonious beer, surprising and complex aromas .

        In spite of modern brewing technology, this beer is brewed according to ancient traditions. It unites, now as in the past, the best products of our soil: rich barley and fine hops.. 

Its refined character, with a pure and rich taste, will captivate you. It is matured at length in cellar and bottle, and is guaranteed to be brewed only from pale malts. It is traditionally top-fermented and is 100% pure. The Gouden Carolus Triple has a unique colour and a full flavour due to its well-balanced hopping. 

To properly savour the Golden Carolus Triple, pour slowly in one movement leaving the yeast deposit in the bottle. This beer may be served cool but not chilled: 7-8°C is recommended. 

In 2002 this beer won the Gold Award in the World Beer Cup, San Diego, USA in the Triple category.

        Naked Elf takes a hard look at the less-is-more theory. Ever since we developed The Mad Elf, weve speculated what it would taste like without the cherries and honey.

So what lies beneath the fruit? Naked Elf is unfiltered, so the spicy yeast taste is more prominent in this strong, hazy orange ale. The combination of the Pilsner, and Vienna malts give a lot of body and minimal sweetness, but Naked Elf has a dry finish. Finally, the heat of the alcohol makes its presence known in the finish.

The Naked Elfs finest quality is the delicate balancing act between a lively yeast kick and a slight alcohol note that lingers in the back of the mouthconstantly reminding us not to overindulge in this complex, warming elixir.

        La Triple dabbaye, popularisée depuis des décennies par les moines Trappistes, est lune des plus puissantes, élégantes et redoutables bières provenant de Belgique. Nous brassons la nôtre avec 100% de malt pale et une levure belge qui apporte des esters fruités ainsi quun côté épicé subtil sur une finale sèche. Cette bière étant parfaite pour notre série en barrique, nous avons décidé de la faire vieillir dans des barils de vins rouges, incluant les cépages Pinot Noir, Merlot et Cabernet Sauvignon. /////  The Abbey Tripel, popularized for decades by Trappist breweries, is one of the strongest, most elegant and dangerously drinkable beer styles to come from Belgium.  We brewed ours with 100% pale malt, and two different Belgian yeast strains that contribute fruity esters and subtle spicy phenolics, as well as a dry finish.  A beer like this is a perfect fit for our barrel aging program, so we chose to age it in a mix of red wine barrels, including Pinot Noir, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.

        "Tournay Triple is seductively strong 
Triple beers traditionally contain more malt, and are therefore stronger. But the original idea behind Tournay Triple was to produce a very hopped beer rather than a strong one.
When creating all our beers, we want to preserve a balance between the tastes and to ensure that each ingredient can be expressed without crushing the others. To respond to the bitterness of the hops, we therefore had to brew a solidly-built beer, whence the choice of a high alcohol content (more than 9% ABV).
Although we had quickly succumbed to the very particular flavours of the New Zealand hop, Nelson Sauvin, many tests were necessary to find the right marriage with other hops, including the English Fuggles, and Cascade, which is the hallmark of all our beers except for Saison.
The perfecting of our Triple was therefore a labour of Hercules but it was well worth the trouble!"

         Named for the scenic ridge that runs between Blanco and Wimberly, Devil's Backbone is a Belgian-style trippel. Brewed in the traditional manner, Czech Saaz hops and Belgian yeast give this ale its distinctive flavor and aroma. Candy sugar made in-house at the brewery adds strength without increasing heaviness. The result is a deceptively strong, pale golden ale.

        Fermented with yeast isolated from a Belgian monastic brewery, this strong abbey-style beer is hopped with varieties from both the Pacific Northwest and Europe.  The beer then undergoes several months of bottle aging with two strains of Brettanomyces wild yeast, including a local Quebec strain.  The resulting beer is drier than a typical Belgian abbey beer, and has additional complexity in both aroma and flavour courtesy of the wild yeast.  ///////////  Fermentée avec une levure provenant dune brasserie monastique belge, cette bière forte dAbbaye est houblonnée avec des houblons de la côte Ouest américaine et dEurope. Cette bière a subi un vieillissement de quelques mois en bouteille avec deux souches de levures Brettanomyces, dont lune est québécoise. Il en résulte une bière plus sèche que les bières dAbbaye, plus complexe en arômes et en saveurs, et ce, grâce aux levures sauvages.

        TRES is the name of our special seasonal that celebrates our 3 year anniversary. This Belgian Tripel is 7.5% ABV and pours a deep gold color. The nose is a complex marriage of citrus fruit, clove, and a floral sweetness. The taste is sweet and complex with a soft malt character that fades into a subtle, quick succession of lemon zest and spicy hops. The finish is dry and clean with a light, lingering complexity that prompts another sip. TRES is a little sneaky as the ABV is impossible to perceive by taste alone. Its a beer that were proud to use to celebrate our 3rd birthday, and we hope youll join us in enjoying a glass!

        This beer has a white, smooth and very compact head. Its pale amber colour is very characteristic revealing a distinctive maltiness. It has a rich aroma with a unique combination of aromatic hops, spices and the typical bouquet of fermentation - very fruity. Secondary fermentation in the bottle gives it a unique aroma due to the presence of yeast. St Feuillien Triple has a very strong and exceptionally lingering taste thanks to its density and its long storage period.
